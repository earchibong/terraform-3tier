# Deploy A Secure And Scalable Three-Tier Architecture On AWS With Terraform

A three-tier architecture is a software design pattern or architecture that divides an application into three main logical layers or tiers, each responsible for specific functionalities and tasks. These tiers are loosely coupled, meaning they can be developed and maintained independently, allowing for easier scalability and maintenance of the overall system. The three tiers are typically named as follows:

**Presentation Tier (Frontend):**
The presentation tier, also known as the frontend, is the top layer that interacts directly with users and handles user interfaces and user interactions. It is responsible for presenting the data and results to the end-users in a human-readable format. In a web application, this tier includes the web browser or mobile app through which users interact with the application. The primary goal of this tier is to provide a user-friendly interface and receive user input, which is then forwarded to the application tier.

**Application Tier (Backend):**
The application tier, also known as the business logic or backend, is the middle layer that processes user requests, performs data processing, and implements the business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the database tier. This layer handles tasks such as data validation, business rules, and workflows. It is also responsible for processing and manipulating data retrieved from the database and preparing it for presentation in the frontend.

**Database Tier:**
The database tier is the bottom layer responsible for storing and managing data used by the application. It stores and retrieves data requested by the application tier. This layer could use various database systems like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) based on the application's requirements. The database tier ensures data persistence and integrity, enabling the application to maintain and manage large amounts of structured or unstructured data.

## Advantages of Three-Tier Architecture:

**Scalability:** The architecture's modularity allows each tier to be scaled independently, making it easier to handle increasing workloads.
**Maintainability:** The separation of concerns makes it easier to update or modify one tier without affecting the others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or issues.
**Security:** By restricting direct access between tiers, it enhances the overall security of the system.
**Flexibility:** Each tier can be developed using different technologies and languages, providing flexibility for the development team.
**Reusability:** The separation of concerns allows for better code re-use across different projects.

Overall, the three-tier architecture provides a structured and organized way to design and build complex applications, making them more manageable, scalable, and maintainable over time.

## Project Steps

<br>

<br>

## Set up the Terraform environment:
Before you proceed, make sure you have Terraform installed and configured to interact with your AWS account.
Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration and initialize it with the necessary files:

```

mkdir three-tier
cd three-tier

```
